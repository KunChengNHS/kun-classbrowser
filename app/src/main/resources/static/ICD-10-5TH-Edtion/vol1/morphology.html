   <h2 id="h2_id">Morphology of neoplasms</h2> 
   <p>The morphology of neoplasms is coded using the <i>International classification of diseases for oncology </i>(ICD-O). Its morphology list was formerly included in ICD-10, but became outdated soon, owing to the updates of ICD-O. As a result, it was decided to discontinue the inclusion of ICD-O codes in ICD-10 from 2016. Interested users can download the ICD-O lists from the classification website of WHO (www.who.int/classifications)</p> 
   <p>ICD-O is used mostly in tumour or cancer registries for coding the site (topography) and the histology (morphology) of neoplasms, usually obtained from a pathology report.</p> 
   <p>ICD-O is a multi-axial classification of the site, morphology, behaviour and grading of neoplasms.</p> 
   <p>The topography axis uses the ICD-1O classification of malignant neoplasms (except those categories that relate to secondary neoplasms and to specifi morphological types of tumours) for all types of tumours, thereby providing greater site detail for non-malignant tumours than is provided in ICD-1O. In contrast to ICD-1O, ICD-O includes topography for sites of haematopoietic and reticuloendothelial tumours.</p> 
   <p>The morphology axis provides five-digit codes ranging from M-8000/0 to M-9989/3. The first four digits indicate the specific histological term. The fifth digit after the slash (/) is the behaviour code, which indicates whether a tumour is malignant, benign, in situ or uncertain (whether benign or malignant).</p> 
   <p>A separate one-digit code is also provided for histologic grading (differentiation). The one-digit behaviour code is as follows:</p> 
   <div style="margin-left: 11ex; position: relative;">
    <b><span style="position: absolute; left: -4ex;">/0</span>Benign</b>
   </div> 
   <div style="margin-left: 11ex; position: relative;">
    <b><span style="position: absolute; left: -4ex;">/1</span>Uncertain whether benign or malignant</b> 
    <div>
     Borderline malignancy
     <sup>1</sup>
    </div> 
    <div>
     Low malignant potential
     <sup>1</sup>
    </div> 
   </div> 
   <div style="margin-left: 11ex; position: relative;">
    <b><span style="position: absolute; left: -4ex;">/2</span>Intraepithelial</b> 
    <div>
     Noninfiltrating
    </div> 
    <div>
     Noninvasive
    </div> 
   </div> 
   <div style="margin-left: 11ex; position: relative;">
    <b><span style="position: absolute; left: -4ex;">/3</span>Malignant, primary site</b>
   </div> 
   <div style="margin-left: 11ex; position: relative;">
    <b><span style="position: absolute; left: -4ex;">/6</span>Malignant, metastatic site</b> 
    <div>
     Malignant, secondary site
    </div> 
   </div> 
   <div style="margin-left: 11ex; position: relative;">
    <b><span style="position: absolute; left: -4ex;">/9</span>Malignant, uncertain whether primary or metastatic site</b> 
   </div> 
   <br> 
   <div style="left: 10%; right: 10%; border: solid black 1px;font-size:80%;padding: 2ex;">
    <sup>1</sup> Except cystadenomas of ovary in M844-M849, which are considered to be malignant. 
   </div> 
   <p>In ICD-O, the morphology code numbers include the behaviour code appropriate to the histological type of neoplasm.</p> 
   <p>The following table shows the correspondence between the behaviour code and the different sections of Chapter II:</p> 
   <table> 
    <tbody>
     <tr> 
      <th>Behaviour code</th> 
      <th>&nbsp;</th> 
      <th>Chapter II categories</th> 
     </tr> 
     <tr>
      <td>/0</td>
      <td>Benign neoplasms</td>
      <td>D10-D36</td>
     </tr> 
     <tr>
      <td>/1</td>
      <td>Neoplasms of uncertain and unknown behaviour</td>
      <td>D37-D48</td>
     </tr> 
     <tr>
      <td>/2</td>
      <td>In situ neoplasms</td>
      <td>D00-D09</td>
     </tr> 
     <tr>
      <td>/3</td>
      <td>Malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to be primary</td>
      <td>C00-C76, C80-C97</td>
     </tr> 
     <tr>
      <td>/6</td>
      <td>Malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to be secondary</td>
      <td>C77-C79</td>
     </tr> 
    </tbody>
   </table> 
   <p>The ICD-O behaviour digit /9 is not applicable in the ICD context, since all malignant neoplasms are presumed to be primary (/3) or secondary (/6), according to other information on the medical record.</p> 
   <p>Only the first-listed term of the full ICD-O morphology nomenclature appears against each code number in the list given here.</p> 
   <p>Some types of neoplasm are specific to certain sites or types of tissue. For example, nephroblastoma, by definition, always arises in the kidney; hepatocellular carcinoma is always primary in the liver; and basal cell carcinoma usually arises in the skin. For such terms, the appropriate site code has been added in parentheses in ICD-O. The appropriate fourth character for the reported site should be used. The ICD-O site codes assigned to the morphologic terms can be used when the site of the neoplasm is not given in the diagnosis. In ICD-O, site codes have not been assigned to many of the morphology terms because the histologic types can arise in more than one organ or type of tissue.</p> 
   <p>For further detail about the coding of morphology refer to ICD-O.</p> 
   <p><b>Coded nomenclature for morphology of neoplasms</b></p> 
   <p>This is no longer supported in ICD-10 since 2016.</p> 
   <p>Currently, ICD-1O still mentions ICD-O codes in its three volumes. These codes need to be verified against the most recent version of ICD-O.</p>

   <br> 
   <p> Welcome to the OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures Version 4.8, to be used in the NHS from 1 April 2017. </p> 
   <p> The classification is an NHS Fundamental Information Standard developed and maintained by the NHS Digital, Clinical Classifications Service. The classification is used by health care providers and commissioners throughout the NHS. </p> 
   <p> The OPCS-4 is available as an eVersion which replicates the familiar style of the OPCS-4 Tabular List and Alphabetical Index, with the added benefits of a powerful search engine and annotation. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="section valid_tree_node valid_node" id="INTRO_THE_CLASSIFICATION"> 
   <span class="opcs-section-heading">THE CLASSIFICATION</span> 
   <br> 
   <p> The OPCS-4 classification supports various forms of data collection, such as Central Returns and Commissioning Data Sets, as well as other secondary uses of information essential to planning and improving patient care. Among these secondary uses are: </p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>operational and strategic planning,</li> 
    <li>resource use,</li> 
    <li>national and local planning and performance management,</li> 
    <li>epidemiology,</li> 
    <li>Department of Health initiatives, and</li> 
    <li>Information grouped by Healthcare Resource Groups.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p> Developments in healthcare and the increasing diversity of interventions and procedures mean that any classification system can rapidly become out of date. </p> 
   <p> The enhancements provided in OPCS-4.8 continue to reflect changes to clinical care in recent years, and enable clinicians (in collaboration with clinical coders) to better describe interventions and procedures. As a result the enhanced classification will further improve the quality of coded clinical data. The ability to provide improved clinical information continues to ensure the classification also meets the needs of NHS funding via the National Tariff Payment System. </p> 
   <p> This version has been completed in collaboration with Consultant Specialists from the Department of Health and clinical Expert Working Groups representing the Royal Colleges. Their support in delivering the revised classification is gratefully acknowledged. </p> 
   <p> The Clinical Classifications Service is also indebted to all those who made time available to support the development. It would not have been achieved without the valuable input of all those that submitted requests for change and reviewed the proposed changes. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="section valid_tree_node valid_node" id="INTRO_The_Revision_Process"> 
   <span class="opcs-section-heading">The Revision Process</span> 
   <br> 
   <p> The first major revision of OPCS-4 in 15 years was successfully implemented in the NHS in April 2006. The revision was not only a long overdue improvement in the ability to record clinical coding detail, but also met the needs of Government health policy at that time. OPCS-4.3 allowed the NHS to better record clinical interventions and procedures. This feature, which went beyond the recording of surgical procedures found in previous versions of the classification, was reflected in the change of name to OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures. </p> 
   <p>Since 2006, the classification has been regularly updated. The following table lists OPCS-4 versions and the financial year in which they were mandated for use:</p> 
   <table> 
    <tbody>
     <tr> 
      <th>Financial Year</th> 
      <th>Version of OPCS-4</th>

   </table> 
   <p> Since September 2007, the Clinical Classifications Service has made it easier for stakeholders to provide requests for change and track their progress with the launch of the online OPCS-4 Requests Portal. This was designed so anyone could submit their suggestions whenever it suited them. </p> 
   <p> In addition, an up-to-date electronic platform provides a more structured and controlled environment in which to produce and validate changes. This enables continual improvements to the content of both the Tabular List and Alphabetical Index. </p> 
   <p> Among the improvements to this current updated version of OPCS-4 are: </p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>More procedures and interventions are available in the Tabular List.</li> 
    <li>The summary of core changes made to the codes and descriptions are available at:<br> <a href="http://systems.digital.nhs.uk/data/clinicalcoding/codingstandards/opcs4/opcs4.8">http://systems.digital.nhs.uk/data/clinicalcoding/codingstandards/opcs4/opcs4.8</a></li> 
    <li>Refinement and addition of includes, excludes and notes in the tabular list.</li> 
    <li>Refinement and additional entries in the Alphabetical Index.</li> 
   </ul> 
  </div> 
  <div class="section valid_tree_node valid_node" id="INTRO_The_Structure_of_the_Classification"> 
   <span class="opcs-section-heading">The Structure of the Classification</span> 
   <br> 
   <p> The basic structure of OPCS-4 remains unchanged in the latest revision. </p> 
   <p> The Tabular List is mainly comprised of anatomically based chapters, most of which relate to the whole or part of a body system. Each chapter is also designated alphabetically, e.g. Chapter A covers the nervous system and Chapter K the heart. The alphabetic character for each chapter forms the prefix of the 3- and 4- character codes within it. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="section valid_tree_node valid_node" id="INTRO_Capacity"> 
   <span class="opcs-section-heading">Capacity</span> 
   <br> 
   <p> The hierarchical body system structure is no longer as evident when using OPCS-4 and so strict use of the Alphabetical Index and Tabular List notes is imperative to ensure accuracy. </p> 
   <p> New 3-character categories are placed within chapter ranges, and 4-character codes are added to existing categories where space allows. Alternatively, new codes are placed at the end of the specific body system chapter. For example, categories H01 to H03 are operations on the appendix, whereas category H04 relates to operations on the colon and rectum. Therefore, if there is a requirement for a specific operation on the appendix to be included in OPCS-4, and no room exists within the categories (H01- H03), the code will be placed in the most suitable available space, typically at the end of the chapter. </p> 
   <p> There are also instances where an existing full category needs extension. In such cases, and dependent on the chapter capacity, an extended category has been added within the chapter. These categories are referred to as principal category or extended category, and are identified by an accompanying note to ease navigation. </p> 
   <div>
    For example: 
    <div style="margin-left: 2em;"> 
     <div style="padding-bottom: 1em; padding-top: 1em;">
      Principal Category
     </div> 
     <div>
      <b>C46 Plastic operations on cornea</b>
     </div> 
     <div>
      <b>Note: Principal category, extended at C44</b>
     </div> 
     <div style="padding-bottom: 1em; padding-top: 1em;">
      Extended Category
     </div> 
     <div>
      <b>C44 Other plastic operations on cornea</b>
     </div> 
     <div>
      <b>Note: Principal C46</b>
     </div> 
    </div> 
   </div> 
   <p> The extended categories amplify the capacity of the principal category, containing 4-character codes that have a relationship with the 3-character title of the principal category. The four-step coding process will direct the coder from the Alphabetical Index to both the principal and extended categories in the Tabular List. </p> 
   <p> When assigning a .8 or .9 code in the Tabular List, the coder should always select the .8 or .9 code from the principal category. The principal category can be distinguished from the extended category by reference to the note, as in the example above. </p> 
   <p> Once a chapter is full then alpha-numeric categories are assigned using the free alpha O. This has occurred within: </p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>Chapter L Arteries and Veins, </li> 
    <li>Chapter W Other Bones and Joints, and</li> 
    <li>Chapter Z Subsidiary Classification of Sites of Operation.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p> Codes created in this way still form part of an existing chapter, even though they have a different alpha prefix to the rest of that chapter. Such new codes will therefore logically sit at the end of the body system chapter. These codes can be identified by using the Alphabetical Index to determine alignment of the codes to the relevant chapter. </p> 
   <p> In line with previous practice, the Tabular List incorporates a number of inclusion terms, exclusion terms and notes which assist in the correct assignment of appropriate codes. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="section valid_tree_node valid_node" id="INTRO_Scope_of_OPCS-4"> 
   <span class="opcs-section-heading">Scope of OPCS-4</span> 
   <br> 
   <p> The scope of OPCS-4 is regulated by the definition of an intervention (as expressed below) and by OPCS-4 Editorial Principles. An Editorial Steering Committee oversees the content development of the OPCS-4 update. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="section valid_tree_node valid_node" id="INTRO_Definition_of_an_Intervention"> 
   <span class="opcs-section-heading">Definition of an Intervention</span> 
   <br> 
   <p> Interventions are those aspects of clinical care carried out on patients undergoing treatment: </p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>for the prevention, diagnosis, care or relief of disease</li> 
    <li>for the correction of deformity or deficit, including those performed for cosmetic reasons</li> 
    <li>associated with pregnancy, childbirth or contraceptive or procreative management.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p> Typically this will be: </p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>surgical in nature; and/or</li> 
    <li>carries a procedural risk; and/or</li> 
    <li>carries an anaesthetic risk; and/or</li> 
    <li>requires specialist training; and/or</li> 
    <li>requires special facilities or equipment only available in an acute care setting.</li> 
   </ul> 
  </div> 
  <div class="section valid_tree_node valid_node" id="INTRO_Single_Procedure_Analysis_and_Multiple_Coding"> 
   <span class="opcs-section-heading">Single Procedure Analysis and Multiple Coding</span> 
   <br> 
   <p> When a series of operations is recorded, it is traditional, as with diagnostic information, to select the first mentioned procedure or intervention for routine analysis. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="section valid_tree_node valid_node" id="INTRO_Main_intervention_or_procedure"> 
   <span class="opcs-section-heading">Main intervention or procedure</span> 
   <br> 
   <p> When classifying diagnostic information the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) recommends criteria for the selection of the MAIN condition for single-cause analysis. OPCS-4 follows this precedent in that the intervention selected for single-procedure analysis from consultant episodes is the MAIN intervention or procedure carried out during the relevant episode. </p> 
   <p> Multiple interventions are often carried out simultaneously. OPCS-4 adopts the same rules that applied previously; which are that some combinations have been encompassed within a single category whilst others, with a seemingly similar relationship, are required to be coded separately. </p> 
   <p> NB: Users of the classification need to ensure that they apply the instruction notes within the Tabular List - Volume I. These are provided to ensure the selection of the correct codes. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="section valid_tree_node valid_node" id="INTRO_Subsidiary_Classification_of_Methods_of_Operations"> 
   <span class="opcs-section-heading">Subsidiary Classification of Methods of Operations</span> 
   <br> 
   <p> Chapter Y provides `Methods of Operation' codes which are intended for the incorporation of otherwise unclassifiable detail in a far wider range of procedures. For example, Y08 covers different types of laser procedure and identifies the use of this form of treatment when associated with a particular operation. It is not intended that the subsidiary codes derived from this chapter be used in a primary position. They will always be used in a secondary position following a main code from Chapters A - X. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="section valid_tree_node valid_node" id="INTRO_Subsidiary_Classification_of_Sites_of_Operation"> 
   <span class="opcs-section-heading">Subsidiary Classification of Sites of Operation</span> 
   <br> 
   <p> Chapter Z provides a series of site codes which are not intended as primary codes. </p> 
  </div> 
  <div class="section valid_tree_node valid_node" id="INTRO_Retirement_of_a_code"> 
   <span class="opcs-section-heading">Retirement of a code</span> 
   <br> 
   <p> Codes fall out of favour for various reasons and there is a mechanism, called retiring, for handling such codes. However, the retirement of a code is only ever considered as a very last option. If an extraordinary circumstance arises where a code/description is considered invalid or incorrect (usually following classification review) the code, the associated problem, an options appraisal to address it and recommendation(s) are provided to the Editorial Steering Committee for a decision. The support of the relevant professional body would also be required in these circumstances to provide appropriate clinical input. </p> 
   <p> In practice, the code is retired in the classification with a note to that effect and excluded from the metadata file so that it is no longer perpetuated. Additionally, the successor code and the retired code are mapped in the Table of Coding Equivalence. </p> 
   <p> Instances of retirement are represented in the OPCS-4 Tabular Volume 1 and the Codes and Titles file as follows: </p>

   <h2 id="h2_id">Definitions</h2> 
   <div style="margin-left: 11ex; position: relative;">
    <span style="position: absolute; left: -11ex;"><b><i>Note: </i></b></span>These definitions have been adopted by the World Health Assembly (resolutions WHA2O.19 and WHA43.24) under Article 23 of the 
    <i>Constitution of the World Health Organization</i>.
   </div> 
   <h4>1. Causes of death</h4> 
   <p>The causes of death to be entered on the medical certificate of cause of death are all those diseases, morbid conditions or injuries that either resulted in or contributed to death and the circumstances of the accident or violence that resulted in any such injuries.</p> 
   <h4>2. Underlying cause of death</h4> 
   <p>The underlying cause of death is (a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.</p> 
   <h4>3. Definitions in relation to fetal,
    <!-- k --> perinatal, 
    <!-- k --> neonatal and infant mortality</h4> 
   <h5><i>3.1. Live birth</i></h5> 
   <p>Live birth is the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached; each product of such a birth is considered liveborn.</p> 
   <h5><i>3.2. Fetal death [deadborn fetus]</i></h5> 
   <p>Fetal death is death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy; the death is indicated by the fact that after such separation the fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.</p> 
   <h5><i>3.3. Birth weight</i></h5> 
   <p>The first weight of the fetus or neonate obtained after birth.</p> 
   <h5><i>3.4. Low birth weight</i></h5> 
   <p>Less than 25OO g (up to, and including, 2499 g)</p> 
   <h5><i>3.5. Very low birth weight</i></h5> 
   <p>Less than 15OO g (up to, and including 1499 g).</p> 
   <h5><i>3.6. Extremely low birth weight</i></h5> 
   <p>Less than 1000 g (up to, and including, 999 g)</p> 
   <h5><i>3.7. Gestational age</i></h5> 
   <p>The duration of gestation is measured from the fi day of the last normal menstrual period. Gestational age is expressed in completed days or completed weeks (e.g. events occurring 28O to 286 completed days after the onset of the last normal menstrual period are considered to have occurred at 4O weeks of gestation).</p> 
   <h5><i>3.8. Pre-term</i></h5> 
   <p>Less than 37 completed weeks (less than 259 days) of gestation</p> 
   <h5><i>3.9. Term</i></h5> 
   <p>From 37 completed weeks to less than 42 completed weeks (259 to 293 days) of gestation</p> 
   <h5><i>3.10. Post-term</i></h5> 
   <p>42 completed weeks or more (294 days or more) of gestation</p> 
   <h5><i>3.11. Perinatal period</i></h5> 
   <p>The perinatal period commences at 22 completed weeks (154 days) of gestation (the time when birth weight is normally 5OO g), and ends seven completed days after birth.</p> 
   <h5><i>3.12. Neonatal period</i></h5> 
   <p>The neonatal period commences at birth and ends 28 completed days after birth. Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the fi 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into <i>early neonatal deaths</i>, occurring during the fi seven days of life, and <i>late neonatal deaths</i>, occurring after the seventh day but before 28 completed days of life.</p> 
   <p><i>Notes on definitions</i></p> 
   <div style="margin-left: 3ex; position: relative;">
    <span style="position: absolute; left: -3ex;">i.</span>For live births, birth weight should preferably be measured within the first hour of life before significant postnatal weight loss has occurred. While statistical tabulations include 5OOg groupings for birth weight, weights should not be recorded in those groupings. The actual weight should be recorded to the degree of accuracy to which it is measured.
   </div> 
   <div style="margin-left: 3ex; position: relative;">
    <span style="position: absolute; left: -3ex;">ii.</span>The definitions of 'low', 'very low', and 'extremely low' birth weight do not constitute mutually exclusive categories. Below the set limits, they are all- inclusive and therefore overlap (i.e. 'low' includes 'very low' and 'extremely low', while 'very low' includes 'extremely low').
   </div> 
   <div style="margin-left: 3ex; position: relative;">
    <span style="position: absolute; left: -3ex;">iii.</span>Gestational age is frequently a source of confusion when calculations are based on menstrual dates. For the purposes of calculation of gestational age from the date of the first day of the last normal menstrual period and the date of delivery, it should be borne in mind that the first day is day O and not day 1; days O-6 therefore correspond to 'completed week O', days 7-13 to 'completed week 1', and the 4Oth week of actual gestation is synonymous with 'completed week 39'. Where the date of the last normal menstrual period is not available, gestational age should be based on the best clinical estimate. In order to avoid misunderstanding, tabulations should indicate both weeks and days.
   </div> 
   <div style="margin-left: 3ex; position: relative;">
    <span style="position: absolute; left: -3ex;">iv.</span>Age at death during the fi day of life (day O) should be recorded in units of completed minutes or hours of life. For the second (day 1), third (day 2) and through 27 completed days of life, age at death should be recorded in days.
   </div> 
   <h4>4. Definitions related to maternal mortality</h4> 
   <h5><i>4.1. Maternal death</i></h5> 
   <p>A maternal death is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.</p> 
   <h5><i>4.2. Late maternal death</i></h5> 
   <p>A late maternal death is the death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes more than 42 days but less than one year after termination of pregnancy.</p> 
   <h5><i>4.3. Pregnancy-related death (death occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium)</i></h5> 
   <p>A pregnancy-related death is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death.</p> 
   <p>Maternal deaths should be subdivided into two groups:</p> 
   <h5><i>4.4. Direct obstetric deaths</i></h5> 
   <p>Direct obstetric deaths are those resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant state (pregnancy, labour and puerperium), from interventions, omissions or incorrect treatment, or from a chain of events resulting from any of the above.</p> 
   <h5><i>4.5. Indirect obstetric deaths</i></h5> 
   <p>Indirect obstetric deaths are those resulting from previous existing disease or disease that developed during pregnancy and that was not due to direct obstetric causes, but which was aggravated by physiologic effects of pregnancy.</p>
